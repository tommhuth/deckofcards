# React + ExpressJs boilerplate

Opinionated boilerplate for React and Express with my fav tools, including ES2017, linting and testing with Mocha Qunit style. Got tired of setting this up repeatedly, and made this. So far tests are run through Babel, but that might change down the line. Also has Heroku deploy baby steps.
